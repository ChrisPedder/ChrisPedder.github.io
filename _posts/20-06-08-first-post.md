I have been toying with the idea of starting (really *re-starting*) blogging
for a while, but writing content is not what it used to be when all I wrote
about was [bikes](http://overthehillracing.blogspot.com/). In particular,
there seem to be an awful lot of less-than-scrupulous suppliers of writing
platforms (I'm looking at you Medium) who have brought the academic publishing
model to the masses. I resent producing something that I want people to be able
to freely read, only for someone to put a paywall around content they didn't
create to make money.

In parallel, I have wanted to dip a toe in the water of web development for a
while, and although this is just a static page written in Jekyll, it's enough
of a toe for me for now.

So here we are, welcome to my blog!
