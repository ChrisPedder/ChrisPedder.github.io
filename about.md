Hi, I'm Chris, a machine learning engineer. Professionally, I have been:

- a physicist
- a sensor designer
- a physicist again
- a computer vision engineer

and I currently am using deep learning techniques to build a contextual, natural language search engine.

This is an about page for my GitHub pages site.
I plan to use this is as a store for my thoughts on:

- machine learning and natural language.
- inference and statistics.
- general technology
